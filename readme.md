# Resources for Mod 1 BEE

We (mod 2) want to help you (mod 1) as much as possible in these first six weeks of Turing.

It's a bit of a fire-hose for you so far, but we're pulling together resources in a few ways:

- **Pairing** so we can pair with you on whatever you're working on
- **Tips and tricks** that served us well

## Pairing

With a few exceptions, you'll have to initiate a pairing session.

We're all _really_ eager to help you, so please pair with us! It's fun for us, and it'll be useful to you.

Here's the folks you can pair with, along with a blurb from each of them:
